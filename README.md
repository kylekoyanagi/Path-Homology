# Path Homology
Program to compute path homology of digraphs (directed grgaphs). 
Program is written by Kyle Koyanagi under the supervision of Chris Kapulkin. <br>
There are 3 file in this program: smith.jl, homology.jl, and main.jl. <br>
> smith.jl includes all functions that are used to compute smith normal form. <br>
> homology.jl includes all functions that compute the path homology of a digraph. <br>
> main.jl is where the path homology is computed and has examples of different digraphs.<br>
